## Active Trades

| Trade ID | Ticker | Archetype | Entry | Current | P&L | Days | Status |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|---------|-----|------|--------|
| TRD-20260107-LULU | LULU | Activist | $211.72 | $203.34 | -3.9% | 10 | HOLD |

**Reconciliation Note:** IBKR shows 7 shares of LULU. We have two trade files for LULU (Jan 7 and Jan 14), both claiming 7 shares. The Jan 14 file appears to be a duplicate or ghost file. **Action:** Recommend archiving `TRD-20260114-LULU-ACTIVIST.json`.

*SWX entry estimated from IBKR avg cost (80.49). File needs check.

## Closed Trades

### TRD-20260107-FBIO-PDUFA (Loss)
- **Entry:** $4.27
- **Exit:** $3.86
- **Return:** -9.6%
- **Outcome:** FDA Approved (Thesis Correct), but "Sell-the-News".
- **Lesson:** For small-cap (<$500M) PDUFA plays, approval is often priced in. New rule: Reduce mispricing score if approval probability >85%.

## Catalyst Pipeline Updates

- **TVTX (Travere):** PDUFA extended to April 13, 2026 (Major Amendment). Updated in events.
- **FBIO:** Completed (Approved).
- **New Events:**
    - SNCY (Merger)
    - VTYX (Merger)
    - YORW, GABC, NEWT (Insider Clusters)

## Watchlist Maintenance
- **Review Needed:**
    - `ALNY.md`, `LUV.md` (Older than 7 days)
    - `ATRA`: PDUFA Jan 10 - Check for outcome (likely passed/delayed).

## Action Items
1.  **Fix LULU:** Archive `TRD-20260114-LULU-ACTIVIST.json`.
2.  **Monitor TVTX:** Update watchlist with new date.
3.  **Check ATRA:** Deep dive to find status.
4.  **Score New Mergers:** Analyze SNCY and VTYX spreads.
