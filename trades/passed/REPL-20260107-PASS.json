  "thesis_assessment": {
    "bull_case": "RP1 shows competitive ORR (~33%) in anti-PD1 failed melanoma; PDUFA date April 2026 follows resubmission (suggesting previous issues addressed?); substantial cash balance ($536M) looks optically high.",
    "bear_case": "Cash runway fails 18-month safety buffer requirement. If April 2026 PDUFA results in delay/CRL, company will have <6 months cash remaining, forcing highly dilutive raise or restructuring. Insiders selling in Nov/Dec 2025 adds conviction to the 'pass' decision.",
    "framework_view": "Strict adherence to 18-month runway rule. While $536M is a large absolute number, the high burn rate and limited timeline ('into Q4 2026') creates binary risk at the PDUFA event without sufficient buffer."
  },

  "lessons_learned": [
    "Absolute cash numbers can be misleading; burn rate context is key.",
    "Guidance 'into Q4 2026' when current date is Jan 2026 means <1 year runway.",
    "Insider selling ahead of PDUFA correlates with the financial risk flag.",
    "PDUFA dates for 'resubmissions' imply prior failures/delays, increasing the need for financial buffer."
