  "thesis_assessment": {
    "bull_case": "Post-spin 'RemainCo' (GrowthCo) focuses on high-quality broadband/wireless/theme parks assets. Shedding the declining cable network assets (Versant) should improve multiple expansion. Stock up 3.5% post-spin vs VSNT down 25%, validating quality flight.",
    "bear_case": "Market Cap > $50B kill screen violation. At $100B+, CMCSA is a widely covered institutional staple. The 'conglomerate discount' unwinding is a well-known thesis likely fully priced in. The edge in this transaction likely resides in the sold-off, unloved SpinCo (VSNT) rather than the parent, though VSNT's early performance is poor.",
    "framework_view": "Strict adherence to the $50B cap. CMCSA is too large for this 'special situations' framework which seeks inefficiency in smaller, overlooked capitalization segments."
  },

  "lessons_learned": [
    "Mega-cap parents in spinoffs often fail the specific 'Market Cap Ceiling' screen of this framework.",
    "The opportunity in such large-cap splits typically lies in the smaller SpinCo (VSNT), assuming it isn't a 'garbage barge' (bad assets dumped).",
    "VSNT dropping 25% in 3 days suggests it might be a 'garbage barge' or experiencing indiscriminant selling (forced selling by index funds/parents). VSNT should be analyzed separately if it fits the screens."

  "alternative_plays": {
    "note": "Analyze VSNT (Versant Media Group) separately. It likely passes the Market Cap ceiling screen and may be experiencing 'indiscriminant selling' pressure, a classic spinoff pattern.",
