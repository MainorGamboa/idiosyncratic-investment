  "thesis_assessment": {
    "bull_case": "92% PDUFA approval rate post-NDA; no AdCom required (positive signal); $8B epinephrine market; sublingual film novel delivery mechanism could gain market share; analysts bullish with $8.83 target (+37% upside)",
    "bear_case": "Severe financial distress (Z-Score -5.39); high debt burden with 13.5% interest rate; principal repayments start June 2026 (just 6 months post-PDUFA); cash runway borderline; even with approval, commercialization costs could strain balance sheet; CRL would likely trigger dilutive financing or bankruptcy",
    "framework_view": "Financial kill screens exist precisely for this scenario. Even with 92% base approval rate, the 8% rejection risk combined with -5.39 Z-Score creates unacceptable downside. Company may not survive a CRL or delayed approval. Framework prioritizes capital preservation."

  "lessons_learned": [
    "Z-Score -5.39 is disqualifying regardless of catalyst quality or approval odds",

    "Company raised $85M in August 2025 but still shows severe balance sheet stress",
    "13.5% debt with principal repayments starting June 2026 creates time pressure",
