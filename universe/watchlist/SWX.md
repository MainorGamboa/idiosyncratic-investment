# SWX — Southwest Gas Holdings

## Status: Investigating
**Archetype:** activist
**Event:** EVT-2026-037
**Created:** 2026-01-06

## Thesis (2 minutes)
Carl Icahn (Tier-1) continues to hold an 8.36% stake following the successful separation of Centuri Holdings (completed late 2025). The company is now a pure-play regulated natural gas utility. The resignation of Icahn designee Andrew Teno from the board (Dec 31, 2025) suggests a shift from the active "cooperation" phase to either a value-realization phase (sale of the company) or a disagreement on next steps. Southwest Gas is now a clean acquisition target for larger utility holding companies seeking regulated gas assets.

## Kill Screens
- [x] M-Score: PASS (Utility/Regulated sector, BBB+ S&P Rating)
- [x] Z-Score: 4.95 (PASS - Adjusted for Utility/Non-manufacturing)
- [x] Market Cap: $5.8B (PASS - Ceiling $50B)
- [x] Regulated Revenue Validation: >90% post-Centuri (PASS)

## Key Questions
- [ ] What is the fair value multiple compared to peers like NI, ATO, and SR?
- [ ] Does Teno's resignation signal a "for sale" sign or a cooling relationship?
- [ ] What are the remaining cost-cutting opportunities cited in Icahn's original thesis?

## Quick Take
High-quality activist play in a late-stage value realization phase. The transition to a pure-play utility has de-risked the business significantly. Multiple rerating or a full buyout are the primary catalysts.

## Scoring (Final: 10.0)

### Filter Scores
- **Catalyst:** 1.5 — Centuri separation complete; board resignation (Teno) signals transition to endgame/value realization phase.
- **Mispricing:** 1.5 — Rerating to peer multiples (18-20x) implies ~20% upside from current levels as conglomerate discount fades.
- **Noise Survival:** 2.0 — BBB+ credit rating, $1.5B liquidity, and regulated utility cash flows provide superior volatility protection.
- **Downside Floor:** 2.0 — Regulated rate base and dividend yield (~2.4%) provide a strong technical and fundamental floor.
- **Risk/Reward:** 2.0 — ~3:1 ratio (Target $100, Entry $80, Floor $73).
- **Info Half-Life:** 0.5 — Utility analyst coverage is high, but strategic outcome/buyout edge persists.

**Base Score:** 9.5

### Adjustments
- **Activist Tier:** +0.5 (Carl Icahn - Tier-2)

**Final Score:** 10.0

### Decision: BUY
Score 10.0 exceeds the 8.25 threshold. High conviction setup following de-risking of business model.
