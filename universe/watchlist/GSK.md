# GSK — GlaxoSmithKline plc

## Status: Watchlist (Passes Kill Screens, But May Not Fit Framework)
**Archetype:** PDUFA
**Event:** EVT-2026-007
**Created:** 2025-12-30
**Market Cap:** $98B (Mega-Cap)
**Price:** $48.29

## Thesis (2 minutes)

GSK has a PDUFA date of March 24, 2026 for linerixibat, an IBAT inhibitor targeting cholestatic pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). The drug received orphan designation and showed positive Phase III results in the GLISTEN trial.

**Opportunity:** First-in-class oral treatment for severe itching in rare liver disease (PBC)

**Challenge:** Mega-cap pharma ($98B market cap) makes this unlikely to be a meaningful catalyst. Small market size (orphan indication) means limited revenue potential relative to company size.

## Kill Screens

- [x] **M-Score:** -2.87 ✅ **PASS** (threshold ≤ -1.78) - Low manipulation risk
- [x] **Z-Score:** 1.86 ⚠️ **PASS** (threshold ≥ 1.81) - Barely passes, in "grey zone"

## Key Questions

- [ ] What is the market size for PBC pruritus treatment?
- [ ] What is the expected peak sales for linerixibat?
- [ ] How material is this to GSK's $11.5B quarterly revenue?
- [ ] Are there competing therapies in development?
- [ ] Does GSK fit "idiosyncratic" framework given mega-cap status?

## Quick Take

**Passes kill screens but questionable fit for framework:**

GSK is a financially stable, dividend-paying mega-cap pharma with $98B market cap generating $11.5B in quarterly revenue. While linerixibat represents a legitimate PDUFA catalyst for a novel orphan drug, the impact on GSK's stock is likely minimal due to:

1. **Size mismatch**: $98B company, orphan drug market tiny by comparison
2. **Limited upside**: Even successful approval unlikely to move stock meaningfully
3. **Not "idiosyncratic"**: Large-cap with diversified pipeline, analyst coverage, institutional ownership
4. **Risk/reward unfavorable**: Limited upside, but company has litigation overhang (Zantac)

**Financial Health:** Strong cash flow (£6.3B YTD), growing revenue (+10% YoY), profitable, but elevated debt-to-equity (1.10) and Z-Score in grey zone (1.86) suggest some financial stress for company size.

**Better suited for:** Long-term dividend investors rather than catalyst-driven special situations

## Framework Fit Assessment

❌ **Does NOT fit idiosyncratic framework** despite passing kill screens:
- Market cap too large for single drug approval to be material
- Orphan indication = small revenue opportunity
- Stock trades on fundamentals, not binary events
- Catalyst impact: ~0-3% on approval vs. 50-100%+ for small biotech

## Next Steps

**Recommendation:** PASS on deeper analysis

While GSK passes technical kill screens, it doesn't fit the spirit of the idiosyncratic investment framework. The framework targets underappreciated catalysts in smaller companies where a binary event can drive outsized returns.

For GSK:
- Approval → Stock up 1-3% (modest)
- Rejection → Stock down 0-1% (immaterial)

This is a rounding error for a $98B company.

**If pursuing:** Run `score` skill, but expect low scores on catalyst impact and asymmetric upside given company size.
