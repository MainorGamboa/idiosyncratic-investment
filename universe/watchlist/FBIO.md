# Watchlist: Fortress Biotech (FBIO) / Cyprium Therapeutics

## 1. Investment Thesis
**Archetype:** PDUFA
**Catalyst:** FDA decision on CUTX-101 (copper histidinate) for Menkes Disease.
**Date:** 2026-01-14 (Hard PDUFA Date).

**Narrative:**
CUTX-101 is a treatment for Menkes Disease, a fatal rare pediatric disorder with no approved therapy.
**History:** received CRL in Sep 2025 solely due to **CMC (Manufacturing)** issues at a third-party facility. Efficacy/Safety were NOT questioned.
**Data:** 80% reduction in risk of death; median survival 177 months vs 16 months untreated.
**Status:** Resubmission accepted Dec 15, 2025. PDUFA set for Jan 14, 2026. CMC issues likely resolved.

**Bull Case:**
- Approval is highly likely given efficacy data and nature of CRL (manufacturing fixable).
- Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) potential (worth ~$100M).
- First and only FDA-approved treatment for Menkes.
- Market Cap $132M is low relative to PRV value + commercial potential.

**Bear Case:**
- CMC issues persist (facility not cleared).
- FDA delay (Major Amendment extending review by 3 months).
- Commercial execution risk (rare disease).

## 2. Kill Screens (Passed)
- **Cash Runway:** 19.4 months (Pass > 18)
- **Debt/Equity:** 0.73 (Pass < 0.75)
