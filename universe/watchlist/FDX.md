# FDX — FedEx Corporation

## Status: Investigating
**Archetype:** Spinoff
**Event:** EVT-2026-024
**Created:** 2026-01-01

## Thesis (2 minutes)

FedEx is spinning off FedEx Freight (its Less-Than-Truckload/LTL business) by June 1, 2026. This represents a strategic separation of asset-light express delivery (RemainCo) from the capital-intensive LTL freight business (SpinCo).

**Why This Could Work:**
- **RemainCo (New FDX)** becomes pure-play express/e-commerce logistics, competing with UPS
- **SpinCo (FedEx Freight, ticker: FDXF)** becomes standalone LTL operator comparable to peers like Old Dominion, XPO
- **Valuation unlock**: Freight could command LTL peer multiples as standalone entity, potentially becomes takeover target
- **Capital allocation**: Each entity can optimize investments independently (express = tech/automation, freight = terminal network)
- **Spending $600M** on IT infrastructure ahead of spinoff, signaling serious preparation

**Key Risks:**
- **LTL market weakness**: Freight revenue expected "flat or slightly down" vs earlier "flat or increasing" guidance
- **Leadership concerns**: Wall Street disappointed with internal CEO hire (John Smith) vs external catalyst
- **Timing risk**: June 2026 is far out; market conditions could deteriorate
- **Z-Score in gray zone**: 2.55 indicates some financial stress (though not distress)
- **No framework timing edge**: Unlike APTV (distribution tomorrow), this is 6 months out

**Current Valuation:**
- Price: $288.86 (as of Dec 31, 2025)
- Market Cap: $67.92B (large-cap)
- PE: 15.92 (TTM), Forward PE: 14.83
- Analyst consensus: Buy with $294.68 target (+2% upside)
- Dividend: $5.80 (2.01% yield)

## Kill Screens

- [x] **Beneish M-Score: -2.62** (PASS — well below -1.78 threshold, no manipulation concerns)
- [x] **Altman Z-Score: 2.55** (PASS — above 1.81 threshold, in "gray zone" but acceptable)

## Key Questions

- [ ] What are the standalone financials for RemainCo vs FedEx Freight?
- [ ] What multiple should Freight command vs LTL peers (ODFL, XPO)?
- [ ] How much value is locked up in the Freight business?
- [ ] What is the debt allocation between RemainCo and SpinCo?
- [ ] Is the $600M IT spend creating separation costs or long-term value?
- [ ] Why did Wall Street react negatively to internal CEO hire?
- [ ] What are LTL market conditions likely to be in June 2026?
- [ ] Will there be forced index selling given FDX's large market cap?
- [ ] Historical patterns: Do logistics spinoffs outperform?

## Quick Take

**Entry Timing:** Distribution targeted June 1, 2026. Framework suggests days 30-60 (July 1 - Aug 1). Currently **6 months early** to enter.

**Archetype Fit:** Moderate. Clean separation of express (asset-light, growth) from LTL freight (capital-intensive). Company spending $600M on IT prep, suggesting seriousness. However, no indication of 6+ month preparation that correlates with +50% returns per framework.

**Base Rates:** Year 2 shows peak outperformance for spinoffs. Entry at days 30-60 exploits forced index selling underperformance.

**Concerns:**
1. **Large-cap size** ($67.92B): Framework designed for smaller, overlooked opportunities
2. **LTL market weakness**: Freight guidance downgraded from "flat or increasing" to "flat or slightly down"
3. **Leadership disappointment**: Internal hire vs external catalyst Wall Street wanted
4. **Long wait**: 6 months to distribution vs APTV (tomorrow)
5. **Gray zone Z-Score**: 2.55 indicates some financial stress, though not critical

**Positives:**
1. Clean strategic rationale (express vs LTL separation)
2. Freight could be takeover target post-spin
3. LTL peer multiples suggest valuation unlock potential
4. Strong analyst support (Buy consensus)
5. Both kill screens passed

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor Q3/Q4 earnings for Freight segment performance
2. Watch for distribution ratio announcement
3. Gather standalone Freight financials when filed
4. Run full scoring in April/May 2026 (closer to distribution)
5. Consider entry in July-August 2026 window (days 30-60 post-spin)

**Initial Lean:** Worth monitoring, but not urgent. Large-cap size and 6-month wait reduce urgency. LTL market weakness is concerning. Framework fit is weaker than APTV due to size and timing.
