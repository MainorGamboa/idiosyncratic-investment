# LEN — Lennar Corp

## Status: Investigating
**Archetype:** activist
**Event:** EVT-2026-056
**Created:** 2026-01-19

## Thesis (2 minutes)
Gabelli (GAMCO) has filed a 13D reporting a 5.49% position in Lennar Class B shares (LEN.B). The activist is pushing for charter changes related to the convertibility of Class B shares into Class A shares and broader voting control reforms. Lennar's dual-class structure has historically created a significant valuation gap. Success in narrowing this gap or simplifying the capital structure would be a major value unlock for B-share holders.
