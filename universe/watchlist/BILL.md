## Scoring (Final: 9.5)

### Filter Scores
- **Catalyst:** 1.5 — Cooperation agreement in place, exploring strategic alternatives/sale, investor day H1 2026. No hard date but active process.
- **Mispricing:** 2.0 — Stock down 40% YTD, 85% from peak. Trading at significant discount to intrinsic value. Peers being acquired at premiums.
- **Noise Survival:** 1.5 — SaaS recurring revenue model provides stability, but slowing growth and competition concerns.
- **Downside Floor:** 1.5 — Recurring revenue base, but no hard asset floor. Acquisition floor provides support.
- **Risk/Reward:** 1.5 — Target ~$61 (analyst), entry ~$48, floor ~$40. Ratio 13/8 = 1.6:1, but M&A upside could be 30%+.
- **Info Half-Life:** 0.5 — Activist involvement is public, but strategic process details are not.

**Base Score:** 8.5

### Adjustments

**Final Score:** 9.5

### Decision: BUY
Score 9.5 exceeds threshold 8.25. High-conviction dual activist setup with strategic alternatives in motion.

## Key Questions
- [ ] Will strategic review result in sale or operational improvements?
- [ ] Timeline for investor day announcement?

Rare dual Tier-1 activist situation in a beaten-down fintech. Strategic alternatives process and peer M&A activity create clear catalysts for value realization.
