# LUV — Southwest Airlines Co.

## Status: Investigating
**Archetype:** activist  
**Event:** EVT-2026-029  
**Created:** 2025-12-30

## Thesis (2 minutes)
Elliott’s standstill expires on 2026-04-01, creating a hard governance catalyst if Southwest’s operating performance disappoints in Q1. The threat of renewed activism or a proxy contest can force sharper capital allocation and operational execution, potentially re-rating the stock into the spring meeting window.

## Kill Screens
- [x] M-Score: -2.58 (PASS)
- [x] Z-Score: 2.03 (PASS)

## Key Questions
- [ ] Are Q1 operating metrics (CASM, RASM, load factor, reliability) improving or deteriorating into the standstill expiration?
- [ ] What are Elliott’s likely demands (board seats, margin targets, asset sales) if they re-engage?
- [ ] Is the April 1 standstill expiration tied to an annual meeting record date that could shift?

## Quick Take
Activist setup with a defined governance trigger; kill screens pass using airline-specific proxies. The catalyst is binary on performance sentiment rather than regulatory approval.

## Context
- **Price:** $41.27 (Stooq close, 2025-12-30)
- **Market Cap:** ~$21.3B (shares outstanding 517,155,080; SEC FY2024)
- **Sector:** Air Transportation, Scheduled (SIC 4512)
- **Event Date:** 2026-04-01 (standstill expiration)
