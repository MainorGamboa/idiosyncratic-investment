# ALNY — Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

## Status: Investigating
**Archetype:** pdufa  
**Event:** EVT-2026-018  
**Created:** 2025-12-30

## Thesis (2 minutes)
Amvuttra (vutrisiran) sNDA for ATTR-CM is a potential multi‑billion‑dollar label expansion that could shift ALNY from a rare‑disease RNAi leader to a mainstream cardiology revenue engine. HELIOS‑B showed clinically meaningful outcomes, and the March 23, 2026 PDUFA is a hard catalyst. If the label supports mortality/CV benefits, Amvuttra can challenge tafamidis and materially re-rate the franchise.

## Kill Screens
- [x] M-Score: -2.60 (PASS)
- [x] Z-Score: 6.13 (PASS)

## Key Questions
- [ ] Will the FDA label explicitly include mortality or CV event reduction language?
- [ ] What is the expected uptake curve vs tafamidis given route of administration and payer posture?
- [ ] Does the catalyst move the needle for a ~$52.5B market cap, or is it already priced?

## Quick Take
Large-cap biotech with a meaningful catalyst; financial health screens are strong. Framework fit is acceptable if ATTR-CM TAM and label language are truly step-change, otherwise impact may be modest relative to size.

## Context
- **Price:** $397.29 (Stooq close, 2025-12-30)
- **Market Cap:** ~$52.5B (shares outstanding 132,113,818; SEC Q3 2025)
- **Sector:** Pharmaceutical Preparations (SIC 2834)
- **PDUFA Date:** 2026-03-23
