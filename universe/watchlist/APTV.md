# APTV — Aptiv PLC

## Status: Investigating
**Archetype:** Spinoff
**Event:** EVT-2026-022
**Created:** 2026-01-01

## Thesis (2 minutes)

Aptiv is spinning off its Electrical Distribution Systems (EDS) business, branded "Cyprium," in Q1 2026. This represents a classic spin-off pattern where a legacy wiring/harness business (commodity, mature) is separated from a higher-growth Advanced Safety & User Experience business (ADAS, software, autonomous driving tech).

**Why This Could Work:**
- **RemainCo (New APTV)** focuses on higher-margin ADAS/software with better multiple potential
- **SpinCo (Cyprium/EDS)** becomes pure-play electrical architecture supplier with standalone value discovery
- **Investor Day (Nov 2025)** already provided 2028 targets, suggesting credible mid-term strategy
- **Optimal entry window**: Days 30-60 post-distribution (Feb 1 - March 3, 2026) per framework guidelines
- Distribution date: Jan 2, 2026; regular-way trading begins Jan 5, 2026

**Key Risks:**
- Auto sector cyclicality (APTV has beta of 1.52)
- EDS business is commodity-like with lower margins
- RemainCo remains exposed to EV transition risks
- Z-Score of 2.39 is in "gray zone" (moderate financial stress)

**Current Valuation:**
- Price: $76.09 (as of Dec 31, 2025)
- Market Cap: $16.44B
- PE: 58.43 (TTM), Forward PE: 9.60
- Analyst consensus: Buy with $92.25 target (+21% upside)

## Kill Screens

- [x] **Beneish M-Score: -2.88** (PASS — well below -1.78 threshold, low manipulation risk)
- [x] **Altman Z-Score: 2.39** (PASS — above 1.81 threshold, though in "gray zone")

## Key Questions

- [ ] What are the standalone financials for RemainCo vs SpinCo?
- [ ] What are the specific 2028 targets from Nov 2025 Investor Day?
- [ ] Is there forced index selling pressure given APTV's market cap?
- [ ] What is management's track record at both entities?
- [ ] What is the debt allocation between RemainCo and SpinCo?
- [ ] Are there any pension/legacy liabilities being separated?
- [ ] What multiple should RemainCo command vs current APTV?
- [ ] Historical patterns: Do auto parts spinoffs outperform?

## Quick Take

**Entry Timing:** Distribution is Jan 2, 2026. Framework suggests days 30-60 (Feb 1 - March 3). Currently too early to enter.

**Archetype Fit:** Strong. Clean separation of legacy/commodity (EDS) from growth/high-margin (ADAS/software). Parent has spent 6+ months preparing (announcement was earlier in 2025), which correlates with +50% first-year returns per framework.

**Base Rates:** Year 2 shows peak outperformance for spinoffs. Entry at days 30-60 exploits forced index selling underperformance in first 5 days (-2.4% to -3.7%).

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for distribution (Jan 2)
2. Monitor SpinCo (Cyprium) pricing in first 30 days
3. Gather standalone financials when filed
4. Run full scoring in late January / early February
5. Consider entry in Feb 1-March 3 window

**Initial Lean:** Worth deep dive. Screens passed cleanly. Strong strategic rationale. Timing discipline critical.
