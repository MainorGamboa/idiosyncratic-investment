# Watchlist: Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU)

## 1. Investment Thesis
**Archetype:** Activist (Tier-1)
**Catalyst:** Elliott Management (Paul Singer) $1B+ stake (~2%) and demand for CEO replacement.
**Date:** Ongoing (Campaign revealed Dec 2025, CEO exit demanded by Jan 2026).

**Narrative:**
Lululemon has suffered from execution errors, slowing growth, and margin compression. Elliott Management sees a "financial engineering" and "brand cleanup" opportunity.
Key Demand: Replace CEO Calvin McDonald with Jane Nielsen (ex-Ralph Lauren CFO/COO).
Rationale: Nielsen has a track record of brand restoration and operational discipline.
Valuation: LULU is trading well below historical multiples due to recent underperformance.

**Bull Case:**
- Leadership change catalyzes operational turnaround.
- Cost cutting and margin expansion.
- Brand equity remains strong despite execution slips.
- Potential share buybacks authorized by new board influence.

**Bear Case:**
- Brand heat has permanently cooled (competition from Alo, Vuori).
- Consumer spending slowdown.
- Activist battle becomes protracted/distractive.

## 2. Kill Screens (Passed)
- **M-Score:** -1.96 (Pass < -1.78)
- **Z-Score:** 6.76 (Pass > 1.81)
- **Market Cap:** $24B (Pass > $500M)
- **Liquidity:** High daily volume.

## 3. Key Metrics
- **Price:** $211.72
- **Market Cap:** $24B
- **Revenue:** $4.9B (TTM)
- **Net Income:** $685M (TTM)
- **Activist Ownership:** ~$1B (~2% implied)

## 4. Risks
- **Execution Risk:** Turnarounds in fashion/retail are notoriously difficult.
- **Consumer Preferences:** Fickle nature of athleisure trends.
- **Valuation:** Still trades at a premium to general retail, though compressed for LULU history.

## 5. Precedents
- **Starbucks (SBUX) / Elliott (2024):** Elliott involvement led to CEO change (Brian Niccol) -> Stock +20%.
- **Pinterest (PINS) / Elliott (2022):** Operational improvements, margin expansion.

## 6. Decision Log
- **2026-01-07:** Added to watchlist. Passed kill screens. High priority due to Tier-1 Activist.
