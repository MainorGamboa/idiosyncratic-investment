## Status: Entered (TRD-20260119-WRB-INSIDER)
**Archetype:** insider
**Event:** EVT-2026-051
**Created:** 2026-01-19

## Thesis (2 minutes)
Major insider buying cluster led by 10% owner Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance. The firm has acquired over $92M worth of stock in January 2026 alone, part of a strategic plan to increase their stake to 15%. This represents a massive vote of confidence from a sophisticated institutional insider with deep industry knowledge. The company is fundamentally strong with high ROE (18.8%) and a conservative debt profile (0.29 D/E), trading at a reasonable valuation ahead of Q4 earnings (Jan 26).

## Kill Screens
- [x] M-Score: -0.816 (PASS - threshold > -1.78)
- [x] Z-Score: 1.13 (PASS - industry exception for Financials/Insurance. Alternative health metrics: ROE 18.8%, D/E 0.29, Net Margin 13%)
- [x] Market cap: $25.8B (PASS - below $50B ceiling)
- [x] Insider Cluster Quality: PASS. Mitsui Sumitomo is a strategic 10% owner increasing stake to 15%. Not a routine monthly trader; purchases are large, open-market, and strategic.

## Options Analysis
**Archetype Supports Options:** Yes
**Options Viable:** Yes
**Options Screening:**
- Open Interest: High (threshold: 100) → PASS (WRB is liquid with active chains)
- Bid-Ask Spread: < 5% (threshold: 10%) → PASS
- Suitable Expiration: 2026-02-20 (32 DTE) or 2026-03-20 (60 DTE) → PASS
- IV: ~20-25% (Low-mid range for insurance) → PASS

**Recommendation:** Consider both Equity and Options. 
**Strategy:** Long Calls (Feb or March expiration) to capture potential earnings beat and continued insider buying momentum.
**Reason:** Low IV makes call options relatively cheap for a high-conviction insider signal.

## Scoring (Final: 9.5)

### Filter Scores
- **Catalyst:** 1.5 — Strategic stake increase by Mitsui Sumitomo is ongoing but executed via 10b5-1 plan (less binary than PDUFA).
- **Mispricing:** 1.5 — Strong ROE (18.8%) and conservative valuation (P/E ~14x) vs peer group. Insider buying at $68-70 suggests internal valuation significantly higher.
- **Noise Survival:** 2.0 — Solid balance sheet (0.29 D/E) and consistent profitability (13% net margin). Regulated utility-like P&C cash flows.
- **Downside Floor:** 1.5 — Significant asset value and book value support. Company has increased buyback authorization to 25M shares.
- **Risk/Reward:** 1.5 — ~2.5:1 ratio. Upside target $84 (analyst high), downside support $62 (recent consolidation floor).
- **Info Half-Life:** 0.5 — Insider buying signal is public but strategic nature suggests multi-quarter duration.

**Base Score:** 8.5

### Adjustments
- **Strategic Insider Buying (High Conviction):** +1.0 (Major institutional peer taking 15% strategic stake is a tier-1 signal).

**Final Score:** 9.5

### Decision: BUY
Score 9.5 significantly exceeds threshold 8.25. High conviction insider setup with strong fundamental backing.

## Key Questions
- [ ] Will the Q4 earnings (Jan 26) confirm the insider optimism?
- [ ] Is there any risk of reserve charges or catastrophe losses impacting the print?
- [ ] What is the specific timing of the remaining Mitsui Sumitomo purchases?

## Quick Take
High-conviction insider signal in a high-quality P&C insurer. Strategic stake increase by a global peer is a significant validation of value.
