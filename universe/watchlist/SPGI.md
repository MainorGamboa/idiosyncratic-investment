# SPGI — S&P Global Inc.

## Status: Investigating
**Archetype:** spinoff  
**Event:** EVT-2026-023  
**Created:** 2025-12-30

## Thesis (2 minutes)

**Updated:** 2026-01-01

S&P Global announced on April 29, 2025, its intent to spin off S&P Global Mobility (CARFAX, automotive data/analytics) within 12-18 months, targeting late 2026. This could unlock significant value as Mobility ($1.6B revenue, 11% of total) separates from core businesses (Ratings, Market Intelligence, Commodity Insights, Indices).

**Why This Could Work:**
- **Value unlock estimate**: $5B-$8B for shareholders
- **Pure-play premium**: Mobility trades at automotive data/analytics multiples; RemainCo focuses on high-margin ratings/indices
- **Different investor bases**: Auto data investors vs. financial data investors
- **Strong core remains**: RemainCo (89% of revenue) has 52% operating margins projected by 2029
- **Executive team in place**: SpinCo leadership already appointed (CPO, CLO, CIO)
- **Tax-free structure**: Expected to be tax-free to SPGI shareholders

**Key Risks:**
- **Mega-cap size** ($158.24B) - Widely followed, likely priced in since April announcement
- **8-9 month wait**: Late 2026 target is distant
- **Mobility is small**: Only 11% of revenue, may not move needle for $158B company
- **Already scored CONDITIONAL**: 7.5 score suggests limited upside vs risk

## Kill Screens

**Initial screening (2025-12-30):**
- [x] **Beneish M-Score: -2.44** (PASS — well below -1.78 threshold)
- [x] **Altman Z-Score: 5.10** (PASS — well above 1.81 threshold, safe zone)

**Re-verified (2026-01-01):**
- [x] **Beneish M-Score: -2.53** (PASS — consistent with prior screening)
- [x] **Altman Z-Score: 5.10** (PASS — strong financial health maintained)

## Key Questions
- [ ] What are Mobility standalone margins and growth vs SPGI core?
- [ ] Is the spin structured as tax-free and will there be index inclusion gaps for Mobility?
- [ ] How will SPGI deploy proceeds or retained cash flow post-spin?

## Quick Take
Strong financial health and a clear corporate catalyst. Primary risk is whether value unlock is already priced into a mega-cap name.

## Scoring (Final: 7.5)

### Filter Scores
- **Catalyst:** 2.0 — Targeted Q2 2026 spin-off date for Mobility division
- **Mispricing:** 1.0 — Mega-cap but potential sum-of-parts unlock; Mobility may trade at premium data/analytics multiples
- **Noise Survival:** 2.0 — Exceptionally strong balance sheet, high cash flow generation
- **Downside Floor:** 2.0 — Core ratings and indices business is high-quality with recurring revenue
- **Risk/Reward:** 0.5 — Modest setup for mega-cap; value unlock potential but not clear 2:1+ ratio
- **Info Half-Life:** 0.0 — Widely followed mega-cap; edge likely compressed as spin details become public

**Base Score:** 7.5

### Adjustments
None applicable

**Final Score:** 7.5

### Decision: CONDITIONAL

Score 7.5 is in the 6.5–8.24 range. Needs confirmation of standalone valuations for Mobility vs RemainCo and clear mispricing evidence. Consider waiting for Form 10 filing to assess margins, growth, and comp set before committing capital.

## Updated Assessment (2026-01-01)

**Framework Fit:** WEAK (similar to HON, FDX mega-cap concerns)

SPGI shares the same **mega-cap limitation** as HON ($123.86B) and FDX ($67.92B). At $158.24B market cap:
- Widely followed by all major institutions
- Spinoff announced April 2025 (8 months ago) - market aware
- 13 analyst coverage with Strong Buy consensus
- Not an "overlooked" idiosyncratic opportunity

**Additional Concerns:**
1. **Mobility is only 11% of revenue** - Small tail wagging large dog
2. **Already scored CONDITIONAL (7.5)** - Below BUY threshold of 8.25
3. **8-9 month wait** to late 2026 distribution
4. **Value unlock ($5B-$8B) is 3-5%** of current market cap - modest
5. **Stock down -1% since screening** ($527.69 → $522.59)
