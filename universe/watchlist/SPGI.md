# SPGI — S&P Global Inc.

## Status: Investigating
**Archetype:** spinoff  
**Event:** EVT-2026-023  
**Created:** 2025-12-30

## Thesis (2 minutes)
The planned spin-off of the Mobility division in Q2 2026 could unlock a higher standalone multiple for the auto data business and sharpen the remaining SPGI focus on ratings and indices. Separation may attract different investor bases and surface sum-of-the-parts value if Mobility trades at premium data/analytics comps.

## Kill Screens
- [x] M-Score: -2.44 (PASS)
- [x] Z-Score: 5.10 (PASS)

## Key Questions
- [ ] What are Mobility standalone margins and growth vs SPGI core?
- [ ] Is the spin structured as tax-free and will there be index inclusion gaps for Mobility?
- [ ] How will SPGI deploy proceeds or retained cash flow post-spin?

## Quick Take
Strong financial health and a clear corporate catalyst. Primary risk is whether value unlock is already priced into a mega-cap name.

## Context
- **Price:** $527.69 (Stooq close, 2025-12-30)
- **Market Cap:** ~$159.8B (shares outstanding 302,800,000; SEC FY2023)
- **Sector:** Services-Consumer Credit Reporting, Collection Agencies (SIC 7320)
- **Event Date:** 2026-06-30 (targeted Q2 2026)

## Scoring (Final: 7.5)

### Filter Scores
- **Catalyst:** 2.0 — Targeted Q2 2026 spin-off date for Mobility division
- **Mispricing:** 1.0 — Mega-cap but potential sum-of-parts unlock; Mobility may trade at premium data/analytics multiples
- **Noise Survival:** 2.0 — Exceptionally strong balance sheet, high cash flow generation
- **Downside Floor:** 2.0 — Core ratings and indices business is high-quality with recurring revenue
- **Risk/Reward:** 0.5 — Modest setup for mega-cap; value unlock potential but not clear 2:1+ ratio
- **Info Half-Life:** 0.0 — Widely followed mega-cap; edge likely compressed as spin details become public

**Base Score:** 7.5

### Adjustments
None applicable

**Final Score:** 7.5

### Decision: CONDITIONAL
Score 7.5 is in the 6.5–8.24 range. Needs confirmation of standalone valuations for Mobility vs RemainCo and clear mispricing evidence. Consider waiting for Form 10 filing to assess margins, growth, and comp set before committing capital.
