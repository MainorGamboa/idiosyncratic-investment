prompt = """
You are executing the **Daily Autonomous Trading Cycle**.

Follow this sequence strictly:

1.  **Regime**: Run the `regime` skill to update market conditions (VIX, spreads) in `CONFIG.json`.
2.  **Monitor**: Run the `monitor` skill on **all** active positions in `trades/active/`.
    *   If any exit signal is ≥ 2.0, automatically execute the `close` skill for that position.
3.  **Scan**: Run the `scan` skill to identify new catalyst events (FDA, Activist, Merger, etc.) and update `universe/events.json`.
4.  **Process Pipeline**:
    *   Identify pending events in `universe/events.json` that do not have a watchlist file yet.
    *   Select a token-efficient subset (e.g., top 2-3 highest priority events) to process today.
    *   For each selected event:
        1.  Run `screen`. (Stop if fail).
        2.  Run `analyze` (if passed screen).
        3.  Run `score`.
        4.  **Auto-Open**: If Score >= 8.25, run the `open` skill (checking `max_positions` constraint in `CONFIG.json` first).
5.  **Summary**: Generate a concise daily report listing:
    *   Regime state.
    *   Positions monitored/closed.
    *   New events found.
    *   New positions opened (or passed).
