You are executing the **Weekly Autonomous Review Cycle**.

Follow this sequence:

1.  **Performance Review**: Run the `review` skill.
    *   Analyze all trades closed this week (`trades/closed/`).
    *   Calculate win rate, average return, and P&L.
2.  **Deep Scan**: Run the `scan` skill with extended parameters:
    *   Look forward 90 days for FDA/PDUFA dates.
    *   Look back 7 days for SEC filings.
    *   Ensure `universe/events.json` is comprehensive.
3.  **Watchlist Maintenance**:
    *   Check `universe/watchlist/` for stale items (modified > 7 days ago).
    *   Re-score or archive/delete them if the catalyst has passed or thesis is broken.
5.  **Summary**: Provide a comprehensive weekly report summarizing performance metrics, new high-conviction catalysts found, and system health.
