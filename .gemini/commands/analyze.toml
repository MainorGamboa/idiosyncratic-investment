prompt = """
Perform a deep-dive analysis on **{{args}}**.

Follow this strict pipeline as defined in `GEMINI.md`:

1.  **Kill Screens**: Run the `screen` skill on {{args}}.
    *   If it FAILS, log it to `trades/passed/` (ensure the skill does this) and **STOP**. Report the failure.
2.  **Analyze**: If it PASSES, run the `analyze` skill to populate `universe/watchlist/{{args}}.md`.
3.  **Score**: Run the `score` skill to generate a score (0-11).
4.  **Execution Decision**:
    *   **Score >= 8.25 (BUY)**: Immediately run the `open` skill to size and record the trade (create `trades/active/` JSON).
    *   **Score 6.5 - 8.24 (CONDITIONAL)**: Present the scoring breakdown and ask for manual confirmation to open.
    *   **Score < 6.5 (PASS)**: Log to `trades/passed/` and **STOP**.

Ensure strict adherence to the decision thresholds.
