  "notes": "Weekly scan completed. Most PDUFA dates for Q1 2026 already tracked in events.json from previous scans. Discovered 1 new high-priority PDUFA event (ATRA tabelecleucel, Jan 10). FDA calendar access limited - relied on secondary sources (HCPLive, Rheumatology Advisor, FDA tracker aggregators). No new activist 13D filings found beyond those already tracked (LULU, CWAN, BILL from late December). Merger landscape quiet in early January - most Q1 2026 deals already tracked. Comcast Versant spin-off completed Jan 2 as expected.",
