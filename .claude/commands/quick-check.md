# Quick Check Command

Fast status check without full analysis:

1. Display current regime state from CONFIG.json (VIX level, credit conditions)
2. Run `monitor` skill to check active positions for exit signals
3. Show any active alerts from alerts.json
4. Display quick P&L summary of active trades

Use this for intraday checks or when market conditions change significantly.
